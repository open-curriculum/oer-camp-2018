## Station 1: Publish Station 

- GitHub Account/download \(if using desktop\) 
- Turn on git pages 
- Publish html files from HAX to github - maybe make an “I just published OER using OER Schema!” sign for people to hold and take photos when they are done to tweet?  

## Station 2: Build Station 

- Getting started - what are you working with? \(word file, existing web page etc\) 
- Using HAX - opening it, importing new work, etc. 
- Adding Schema - actual “how to add the schema” & Why 
- Types of Licenses: https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/licensing-types-examples/licensing-examples/

## Station 3: Camp fire

- goal setting, conversations, ideas, collaboration - include info about history of the project and future directions 
- Use a whiteboard for people to leave contact info on to hook up later
