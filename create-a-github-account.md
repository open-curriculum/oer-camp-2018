## Clone the Github repo to your computer

1. Click on "Clone or Download", then choose "Open in Desktop": ![Download repo to desktop](/assets/Screen Shot 2018-05-14 at 11.33.01 AM.png)
2. If you don't already have Github's desktop app installed, you will need to install it now. You will be redirected to the [download page](https://desktop.github.com): ![download github desktop app page](/assets/Screen Shot 2018-05-14 at 11.33.07 AM.png)
3. After installation, you may have to repeat step one. The Desktop will ask you for a location on your desktop to save to. Choose a directory on your computer in "local path", and click "Clone". ![choose a local folder](/assets/Screen Shot 2018-05-14 at 1.25.52 PM.png) ![](/assets/Screen Shot 2018-05-14 at 1.26.12 PM.png)

## Enabling Git Pages

1. To enable Github to serve pages in your repo to the Web, you will need to enable some settings. Go to the "Settings" page: ![settings page](/assets/Screen Shot 2018-05-14 at 12.10.46 PM.png)
2. Scroll down to the "GitHub Pages" section. Under "Source," Choose "Master Branch /docs folder" from the dropdown and hit "Save". This setting means that any folder called `docs` will be accessible via a url: ![choose docs folder](/assets/Screen Shot 2018-05-14 at 12.19.43 PM.png)
3. You will now see a url where you can access your webpage. Copy this URL: ![git pages url](/assets/Screen Shot 2018-05-14 at 3.09.48 PM.png)
4. Now, let's add the URL to the front page of the repo, so others can find it. Go to the front page of the repo and click "Edit" on the far right: ![edit](/assets/Screen Shot 2018-05-14 at 12.27.42 PM.png)
5. In the website section, paste in your copied URL from the settings page: ![Add url](/assets/Screen Shot 2018-05-14 at 12.27.35 PM.png)
5. There is one extra step to get Git Pages working properly. We have to add an empty file called `.nojekyll` to the repository. ![Create new file](/assets/Screen Shot 2018-05-14 at 12.20.33 PM.png)

7. ![Create new file](/assets/Screen Shot 2018-05-14 at 12.20.48 PM.png)
8. You now have your directory set up properly. [See this example](https://github.com/virtual-michael-collins/oer-writing-assignment):
