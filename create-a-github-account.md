## Clone the Github repo to your computer

2. If you don't already have Github's desktop app installed, you will need to install it now. You will be redirected to the [download page](https://desktop.github.com): ![download github desktop app page](/assets/Screen Shot 2018-05-14 at 11.33.07 AM.png)
3. After installation, you may have to repeat step one. The Desktop will ask you for a location on your desktop to save to. Choose a directory on your computer in "local path", and click "Clone". ![choose a local folder](/assets/Screen Shot 2018-05-14 at 1.25.52 PM.png) ![](/assets/Screen Shot 2018-05-14 at 1.26.12 PM.png)
