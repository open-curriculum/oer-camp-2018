## Authoring in HAX

HAX is very much like MS Word, or other word processing software, with one big difference. HAX writes directly to HTML instead of proprietary document formats, and it comes with an "outline" that structures the content, and to allows for navigation.

### The outline

1. To edit the Outline, click on the pencil icon:

2. Enter the title of the page. If the page should be nested, you can use the arrow icons, or use the tab key. Click the floppy disk icon to the top left save.
